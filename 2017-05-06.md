His kayak hitting the side of the river with a soft thunk, Yip jumped off and starting pulling the craft onto the river side. Making sure it was firmly on the ground, he turned around and took a second look at the dark woods that started not far away. Grabbing his bow, a few arrows and his knife, a sharp bone-carved thng, he made his way into the woods.

Yip was on the hunt, trying to find a worthy prey to bring back to his village, it had to be big, not scrawny like the small elk his brother had brought back on his last hunt. His hunt would bring back a real king of the forest, with antlers as big and strong as the branches of an old oak tree. Walking through the forest he made his way to a clearer patch where a slight curve in the terrain obstructed his view enough so that he could not be sure no animals were hididng there. Suddenly, he thought he saw a small animal poke it's nose through a bush on the lowest side of the clearing. Slowly approaching the bush, he held his knife up high, thinking that many animals was better than just one. To his great surprise, the bush hid no animal but the dead white carcass of a man. Suprised, Yip took a step back, looking around himself to make sure that he would not share in the man's downfall. Once certain of being alone, he bent over the body of the dead man, thinking that the body had looked quite peculiar.

Indeed, the white perplexion of the mans skin and hair, that he had taken for a simple trick of the sun, was not a trick at all. He had never seen any man of the sort, even his clothes were strange, they tightly covered his body and were a tint of blue that he had never seen before. He thought to himself << Now that his a catch that will be sure to make me the talk of the village, I will bring this strange white man back to the village and show him to the shaman, perhaps it is a message sent by the great Manitou. ??
